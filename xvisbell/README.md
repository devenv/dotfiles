xvisbell
========

This is a simple program that flashes a white window on the screen whenever the
X11 bell is rung.

The typical way to use this program is to run it in the background in your
.xsession/.xinitrc file. Works best when used with dwm & xmonad & friends.

Why would I use this?
----------------------

If you're like me and you are constantly pressing ^G in Emacs, audio bells can
be annoying. Visual bells are less annoying.

How do I configure this?
------------------------

Edit xvisbell.cpp. If you don't know how to program, then learn how to program.
